# Uninstalls Curiocity from macOS: the app bundle, everything it wrote to
# ~/Library/Application Support, and the small Electron/Chromium cache and
# state folders that come with any Electron app. See ../UNINSTALL.md for the
# full breakdown of what each path is and why it exists — this script is
# just that document made executable.
#
# Nothing here runs at startup (no login item, no daemon), so there's
# nothing to disable first — quitting the app and removing these paths is
# the entire uninstall.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/uninstall.sh            interactive (asks before deleting)
#   ./scripts/uninstall.sh --yes      skip the confirmation prompt
#   ./scripts/uninstall.sh --dry-run  print what would be removed, remove nothing
